The Arthur and Lancelot styles for BibTeX
=========================================

This repository contains two BibTeX style files, titled `arthur.bst` and `lancelot.bst`.

The style files are optimized for physics (more specifically atomic, molecular and optical physics), being relatively similar to the formatting of Physical Review journals. Most importantly, they (1) seamlessly handle hyperlinking to DOIs, and (2) allow proper inclusion of arXiv (or other) eprint links as well as a dedicated preprint entry type.

The two files have different origins:
 - `arthur.bst` was modified by hand from output provided by the `makebst` utility, around 2015.
 - `lancelot.bst` is a hand-modified version of the Physical Review style file, `apsrev4-2.bst`.

The references roughly look as follows:
